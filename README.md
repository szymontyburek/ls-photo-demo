What I learned from creating this product:
- The benefits of end-to-end automated testing. It drastically improved development efficiency in the later stages of prototyping.
- How to control the 2D graphics of images using HTML Canvas and the JavaScript Canvas API.
- The power of the Shadow DOM. I can have an encapsulated component that operates on its own set of rules because of the Shadow DOM.
